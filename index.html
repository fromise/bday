    <br />
    You mentioned wanting something written, and I thought it would be cute to try my hand at making a little site.
    I tried to make it a good combination of both of our interests and tastes, but let me know how I did :]
    <br>
    We haven't known eachother for long, but I'm glad we met. You're a wonderful part of my life and a great person.
    I admire how kind and sensitive you are, I'd like to believe your compassion has made me kinder in turn.
    You're also so talented! Your style is seriously so masterful and beautiful and it's always a pleasure to see your works.
    More than anything, I hope you can always find peace and happiness in your life and that our relationship will continue to grow.
    Somewhere down the line I hope to do even more things with you and stick with eachother through thick and thin.
    This is your day! Remember to be kind to yourself today and try to enjoy it as best as you can. 
    Getting older is strange and it can be painful, but more than anything I think it's a wonderful privilege.
    But even despite that, remember that at the end of the day, your entire life is ahead of you. You have so much potential
    and I know that you have it in you to overcome any adversity. I love you!
